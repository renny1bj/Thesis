# Topic: Bias and Fairness modeling in statistical models for business applications
This page contains the code for my master thesis.

Abstract: Algorithm decision-making systems are now broadly used in several online and offline services.
These systems are complex learning methods that extract information from a large amount of
historical data. Individuals and organizations now make use of this emerging technology for
optimal service functionality and profitability to stay ahead in the highly competitive market. With
the commercialization of these systems, it has become a major concern that these automated
decisions may be directly or indirectly lead to bias a particular group of people with one or
more common sensitive attributes. This research introduces methods to mitigate bias at its
different stages- from data collection processing to data preprocessing to data in-processing to
data postprocessing; explores different algorithmic solutions to ensure fairness in both datasets
and models; and further proffer solutions to managing risks based on business necessities and
industry standards for organizations. These methods showed to be effective for various fairness
metrics by testing and comparing them on real-world datasets at times at the expense of accuracy.
